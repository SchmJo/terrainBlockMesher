Installation notes for IWESOL - IWES Open Library
Copyright Fraunhofer IWES, Oldenburg, Germany
Date: 12 Jan 2015, author: Jonas Schmidt
---------------------------------------------------

This version was written for and tested on Ubuntu 12.04
with OpenFOAM 2.1.1 or 2.3.0 and g++ 4.6.3. Compatibility 
with other OS or other versions of Ubuntu, OpenFOAM or 
compilers are not to be expected.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Installation with OpenFOAM 2.1.1:

(1) Add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:

      export IWESOL=<path to the folder iwesol>
      source $IWESOL/etc/bashrc-2.1.1

    and either open a new terminal or 'source ~/.bashrc'.

(3) Change directory to 'iwesol' and type 'make OF2.1.1'. 
    This should compile the libraries and the applications.

(4) Compile the doxygen documentation by typing
    'make doxygen' inside the folder 'iwesol'. The index
    file is then created at location '$IWESOL/doc/iwesol.html'.

The non-OpenFOAM libraries are located at $OLDEV_CPP_LIB. 
The OpenFOAM libraries created are located at $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN. 
The applications are located at $FOAM_USER_APPBIN.

You can find basic examples in the folder
'iwesol/OF/OF-2.1.1/tutorials/utilities/mesh/terrainBlockMesher'.
